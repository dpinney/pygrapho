### pygrapho Overview

Do you have a gigantic graph, maybe one with 500k nodes and edges? It probably doesn't display well at all when you draw it in matplotlib. Never fear: this package will let you display the graph in [ElGrapho](https://www.elgrapho.com), a high-performance and interactive graph viewer built using WebGL.

### Installation

Install python3 and then `pip install "git+https://github.com/dpinney/pygrapho"`

### Usage

Here's a simple example, rendering to a file:

```python
import pygrapho
graph = {
  "nodes":[{"x":0, "y":0.6}, {"x":-0.4, "y":0}, {"x":0.4, "y":0}, {"x":-0.6, "y":-0.6}, {"x":-0.2, "y":-0.6}, {"x":0.2, "y":-0.6}, {"x":0.6, "y":-0.6}], 
  "edges":[{"from":0, "to":1}, {"from":0, "to":2}, {"from":1, "to":3}, {"from":1, "to":4}, {"from":2, "to":5}, {"from":2, "to":6}]
}
options = {
	'darkMode': True,
	'glowBlend': 0.2,
	'edgeSize': 1,
	'fillContainer': True
}
pygrapho.render_file(graph, options, 'None', open_file=True)
```

The result is rendered to a temporary file and opened:

Pygrapho also works inside jupyter:

INSERT JEAN VALJEAN GRAPH

And it works on huge graphs (this one has 10k vertices):

```python
import pygrapho
pygrapho.render_file(pygrapho._chord_model_example(), pygrapho._test_options, 'Chord', open_file=True)
```

If you'd like more information on the various options available, please see the [ElGrapho documentation, v2.4.0](https://github.com/ericdrowell/ElGrapho/tree/cbb44c8f0e8c18d8c12488583442c1feb53d7679). There are lots of different layout and styling types:

### Todos
- OOO Fix that screenshot.
- OOO Publish python module to pypi. E.g. Install python3 and then run `pip install pygrapho`.
- OOO Convert option for networkx graphs.
- OOO More tests, CI/CD.
- OOO Validate options schema and the model. https://pypi.org/project/schema/
- OOO Remove fstrings for py2 compatibility.
- OOO Leaflet with blank canvas: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28094649/add-option-for-blank-tilelayer-in-leaflet-layergroup
